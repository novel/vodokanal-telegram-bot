# vodokanal-telegram-bot

Parses news from http://www.saratovvodokanal.ru and sends out
announcements to a Telegram channel.
It doesn't do any polling, should be used with `cron` instead.

Parses HTML because saratovvodokanal.ru constantly breaks RSS and e-mail
notifications, so this appears to be the most reliable way in this case.

Should be easy to make it generic enough for parsing news of arbitrary
web sites.

Needs unit tests.
